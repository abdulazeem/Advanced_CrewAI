That compared with the respective Dow Jones estimates for 0.2% and 2.8%.Excluding food and energy, the core CPI increased 0.3% for the month and 3.1% from a year ago, compared with the forecasts for 0.3% and 3%. Federal Reserve officials generally consider core inflation to be a better reading for longer-term trends. The monthly core rate was the biggest increase since January while the annual rate was the highest since February.A 0.2% increase in shelter costs drove much of the rise in the index, while food prices were flat and energy fell 1.1%, the BLS said. Tariff-sensitive new vehicle prices also were unchanged though used cars and trucks saw a 0.5% jump. Transportation and medical care services both posted 0.8% moves higher.Stock market averages posted strong gains after the report though Treasury yields were mixed. Traders ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve would start reducing rates again in September.Tariffs did appear to show up in several categories.For instance, household furnishings and supplies showed a 0.7% increase after rising 1% in June. However, apparel prices were up just 0.1% and core commodity prices increased just 0.2%. Canned fruits and vegetables, which generally are imported and also sensitive to tariffs, were flat.\"The tariffs are in the numbers, but they're certainly not jumping out hair on fire at this point,\" former White House economist Jared Bernstein said on CNBC. Bernstein served under former President Joe Biden.The report comes at both a critical time for the economy and the BLS itself, which has come under Trump's criticism for what he has charged is political bias against him. Trump fired the prior BLS commissioner after a surprisingly weak July nonfarm payrolls report earlier this month, and on Monday said he would nominate E.J. Antoni, a critic of the bureau, as the new chief.watch nowVIDEO3:0603:06Cox: Response rates are falling, making CPI data less reliableWorldwide ExchangeThe bureau has been hampered by budget and staffing cuts and has halted data collection in multiple cities. Along with that, the data has had to impute values in a number of the goods and services it tracks, leading to questions over accuracy and credibility.While the political jockeying has occurred, Fed officials have been watching inflation measures closely as they weigh their next interest rate decision in September.\"Inflation is on the rise, but it didn't increase as much as some people feared,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"In the short term, markets will likely embrace these numbers because they should allow the Fed to focus on labor-market weakness and keep a September rate cut on the table. Longer term, we likely haven't seen the end of rising prices as tariffs continue to work their way through the economy.\"At issue is whether the tariffs will cause a one-time price increase or will lead to a lasting upturn for inflation. Economists generally view tariff impacts as the former though the broad swath of items covered under Trump's edicts have sparked worries that the effect could be longer lasting.Futures market pricing is pointing strongly to a Fed rate cut in September. However, a raft of data between now and then could influence both the decision for that meeting and the central bank's future course. Fed officials of late have been expressing increasing levels of concern about the labor market, which would bode for rate reductions.Traders increased the implied odds for a September move following the release, and also put the chances of another reduction in October at about 67%, up from 55% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.The CPI is not the Fed's primary inflation forecast tool. The central bank uses the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, but the CPI, as well as the producer price index that is scheduled to be released Thursday, feeds into that calculation.Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% for the month, the BLS said in a separate release. That put the annual gain at 1.2%.Don‚Äôt miss these insights from CNBC PROForget Palantir.

      "Consumer prices rose 2.7% annually in July, less than expected, amid tariff worries. The seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month and 2.7% on a 12-month basis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI increased 0.3% for the month and 3.1% from a year ago. The report comes at both a critical time for the economy and the BLS itself, which has come under Trump's criticism for what he has charged is political bias against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the report, traders ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve would start reducing rates again in September. Futures market pricing is pointing strongly to a Fed rate cut in September. Traders increased the implied odds for a September move following the release, and also put the chances of another reduction in October at about 67%, up from 55% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tariffs did appear to show up in several categories, but other areas that normally would be hit by import duties showed little reaction. For instance, household furnishings and supplies showed a 0.7% increase after rising 1% in June. However, apparel prices were up just 0.1% and core commodity prices increased just 0.2%. Canned fruits and vegetables, which generally are imported and also sensitive to tariffs, were flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock market averages posted strong gains after the report though Treasury yields were mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 200 points, or 0.7%, to 27,741. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% to 3,085, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% to 8,321. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation is on the rise, but it didn't increase as much as some people feared, says Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. In the short term, markets will likely embrace these numbers because they should allow the Fed to focus on labor-market weakness and keep a September rate cut on the table. Longer term, we likely haven't seen the end of rising prices as tariffs continue to work their way through the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "At issue is whether the tariffs will cause a one-time price increase or will lead to a lasting upturn for inflation. Economists generally view tariff impacts as the former though the broad swath of items covered under Trump's edicts have sparked worries that the effect could be longer lasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "A widely followed measure of inflation accelerated slightly less than expected in July on an annual basis as President Donald Trump's tariffs showed mostly modest impacts and investors grew more confidence about interest rate cuts ahead. The consumer price index increased a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month and 2.7% on a 12-month basis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. That compared with the respective Dow Jones estimates for 0.2% and 2.8%. \n",
      "\n",
      "The report comes at both a critical time for the economy and the BLS itself, which has come under Trump's criticism for what he has charged is political bias against him. The bureau has been hampered by budget and staffing cuts and has halted data collection in multiple cities. Along with that, the data has had to impute values in a number of the goods and services it tracks, leading to questions over accuracy and credibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the political jockeying has occurred, Fed officials have been watching inflation measures closely as they weigh their next interest rate decision in September. Fed officials of late have been expressing increasing levels of concern about the labor market, which would bode for rate reductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A raft of data between now and then could influence both the decision for that meeting and the central bank's future course. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% for the month, the BLS said in a separate release. That put the annual gain at 1.2%.\n",

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast‚Äôs expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property‚Äîsuch as the use of AI and other novel technologies‚Äîwill continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",
